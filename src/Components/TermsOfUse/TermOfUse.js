                this document carefully. Any other contract or agreement entered
                into between the Owner and the Sellers shall always prevail over

                termination details and c) termination notice can be found in
                the relevant section of these Terms. Please note that some
                provisions in these Terms may only apply to certain categories
                of Users. In particular, certain provisions may only apply to
                Consumers or to those Users that do not qualify as Consumers.
                Such limitations are always explicitly mentioned within each
                affected clause. In the absence of any such mention, clauses
                apply to all Users. How Bookinglane Manager works By accepting
                the Terms, Users fully and unconditionally release and forever
                discharge the Owner, its officers, directors, employees and
                agents from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual or
                consequential, direct or indirect), whether now known or
                unknown, of every kind and nature relating to, arising out of or
                in any way connected with: disputes between Users, or any other
                person or entity, the Products’ use, including, without
                limitation, any and all claims that such use violates any of
                Seller’s intellectual property rights, copyrights, rights of
                publicity or privacy, “moral rights,” or rights of attribution
                and integrity, or Users’ activity on Bookinglane Manager,
                including, but not limited to, Users’ legal capacity, ability to
                complete a transaction, or pay the associated costs. User
                acknowledges and agrees that the Owner has no control over, and
                shall have no liability for any damages resulting from, the use
                or misuse by any other person or entity of any Products. If the
                Owner becomes aware of any Products that allegedly may not
                conform to the Terms, the Owner may investigate the allegation
                and determine in its sole discretion whether to take action in
                accordance with the Terms. The Owner has no liability or
                responsibility to Users for performance or nonperformance of
                such activities. The Owner has the absolute right to remove
                and/or delete without notice any Products within its control
                that it deems objectionable. Users consent to such removal
                and/or deletion and waive any claim against the Owner for such
                removal and/or deletion. The Owner is not responsible or liable
                for failure to store posted content or other materials Users may
                transmit through Bookinglane Manager. Users shall take measures
                to preserve copies of any data, material, content or information
                such User posts on Bookinglane Manager. Any identity
                verification methods the Owner employs is strictly on a best
                efforts basis and shall not be relied upon by Users. Without
                prejudice to its role as a mere technical intermediary as
                described above, the Owner may provide additional services to
                either party of such interaction, such as providing packaging,
                shipping or facilitating dispute resolution. Bookinglane Manager
                merely serves as a technical infrastructure or platform to allow
                Users to interact with each other. The Owner therefore is not
                directly involved in any such interactions between Users. These
                Terms only apply to the described usage of Bookinglane Manager
                as a platform. Terms, conditions and any other provision
                applying specifically to transactions between Buyers and Sellers
                are specified by each Seller.

                submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate

                provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the
                purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the

                Trial period Users have the option to test Bookinglane Manager
                or selected Products during a limited and non-renewable trial
                period, at no cost. Some features or functions of Bookinglane
                Manager may not be available to Users during the trial period.
                Further conditions applicable to the trial period, including its
                duration, will be specified on Bookinglane Manager. The trial
                period shall automatically convert into the equivalent paid
                Product, unless the User cancels the purchase before the trial
                period expires. Subscriptions Subscriptions allow Users to
                receive a Product continuously or regularly over a determined
                period of time. Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment
                is received by the Owner. In order to maintain subscriptions,
                Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner.
                Failure to do so may cause service interruptions. Fixed-term
                subscriptions Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the
                payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription
                period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the
                purchasing process. Once the subscription period expires, the
                Product shall no longer be accessible, unless the User renews
                the subscription by paying the relevant fee. Fixed-term
                subscriptions may not be terminated prematurely and shall run
                out upon expiration of the subscription term. Subscriptions
                handled via Apple ID Users may subscribe to a Product using the
                Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using
                the relevant process on Bookinglane Manager. When doing so,
                Users acknowledge and accept that any payment due shall be
                charged to their Apple ID account; subscriptions are
                automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User
                cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires; any
                and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within
                24-hours before the end of the current period; subscriptions can
                be managed or cancelled in the Users’ Apple App Store account
                settings. The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or
                diverging provision of these Terms. Automatic renewal
                Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment
                method that the User chose during purchase, unless the User
                cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination
                specified in the relevant section of these Terms and/or
                Bookinglane Manager. The renewed subscription will last for a
                period equal to the original term. The User shall receive a
                reminder of the upcoming renewal with reasonable advance,
                outlining the procedure to be followed in order to cancel the
                automatic renewal. Termination Recurring subscriptions may be
                terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous
                termination notice to the Owner using the contact details
                provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the
                corresponding controls inside Bookinglane Manager. Termination
                notice If the notice of termination is received by the Owner
                before the subscription renews, the termination shall take
                effect as soon as the current period is completed.

                respectively as Sellers or Buyers over Bookinglane Manager. This
                means that Sellers and Buyers are solely liable for respectively
                offering and purchasing through Bookinglane Manager and for the
                obligations resulting thereof. In particular, the Owner shall
                bear no liability for: any pre-contractual statement, claim or
                description of the Products offered through/via Bookinglane
                Manager; the existence of any applicable license, authorization,
                qualification or other official permit allowing Sellers to offer
                specific goods or services, as may be required by applicable
                law; the Buyers' eligibility (e.g. in terms of age, solvency
                etc.) for purchase according to applicable law; any obligation
                stipulated by Users over Bookinglane Manager, including but not
                limited to product guarantees and product safety; any claim
                based on partial, incorrect or failed performance of binding
                agreements entered into on Bookinglane Manager. Limitation of
                liability Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without
                prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions,
                Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or
                any natural or legal person acting on its behalf). This does not
                apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages
                resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation
                such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose
                of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross
                negligence, as long as Bookinglane Manager has been
                appropriately and correctly used by the User. Unless damages
                have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they
                affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only
                be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at
                the moment the contract was entered into. In particular, within
                the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for: any
                loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even
                indirect, that may be incurred by the User (such as, but not
                limited to, trading losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or
                anticipated savings, loss of contracts or business
                relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, etc.); damages or
                losses resulting from interruptions or malfunctions of
                Bookinglane Manager due to acts of force majeure, or unforeseen
                and unforeseeable events and, in any case, independent of the
                will and beyond the control of the Owner, such as, but not
                limited to, failures or disruptions of telephone or electrical
                lines, the Internet and / or other means of transmission,
                unavailability of websites, strikes, natural disasters, viruses
                and cyber attacks, interruptions in the delivery of products,
                third-party services or applications; any losses that are not
                the direct consequence of a breach of the Terms by the Owner;
                Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to
                all Users not qualifying as Consumers: In any event of
                liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments
                that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from
                the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or
                the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.

                directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and
